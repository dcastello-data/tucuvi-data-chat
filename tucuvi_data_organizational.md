# What is Tucuvi Data?

**Tucuvi Data** encompasses all the data products and intelligence systems that power Tucuvi's operations. It includes the following key components:

1. **Datasets in BigQuery (BQ)**: A centralized repository for storing events, iterations, and metadata generated by Tucuvi's AI, LOLA, and its supporting systems.
2. **Data Pipelines in Dataform**: Automated processes to transform raw data into structured, actionable insights for reporting and analysis.
3. **Dashboards in Looker Studio**: Interactive visualizations and metrics that provide end-users with trends, KPIs, and operational overviews.

At a high level, the workflow is as follows:

1. **Raw Data Storage**: Data generated by LOLA and other systems is stored as raw events in BigQuery.
2. **Transformation with Dataform**: This raw data is processed and transformed into structured reporting tables optimized for analysis.
3. **Visualization with Looker Studio**: The transformed data is presented in dashboards for hospitals and other stakeholders to monitor operations, track outcomes, and make informed decisions.

This integrated system ensures all client data is centralized, processed, and visualized efficiently, driving value and insight for Tucuvi's users.
